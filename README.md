# Internship Assignment - Government Job Form Analysis (Task 1)

This repository contains my completed submission for **Task 1** of the Data Analytics Internship at **Jobyaari**, a startup revolutionizing government job discovery for students in India.

The task focused on reading complex government job application forms and converting them into structured, searchable data inside an Excel sheet — making it easier for the platform to analyze and display job listings accurately.



# Task Objective

> Extract and analyze 5 government job application forms from a merged PDF and fill the details into a structured Excel format, following the reference tabs (HURL & IIT Palakkad).



## What I Did

Here’s exactly what I did for this assignment:

1. Watched all training videos** shared by the team to understand how form data is structured and how to interpret details like qualification, category-wise reservation, CTC, and selection process.
   - I learned how to merge job listings with similar qualifications (like in HURL).
   - I understood how to carefully read PDFs, pick out only the relevant fields, and match the format.

2. Opened and studied the Merged PDF**, which contained 5 forms:
   - CSIR
   - NHM
   - NTPC
   - TANUVAS
   - AAU

3. Extracted critical information** from each job listing, such as:
   - Post name
   - Number of vacancies
   - Qualifications
   - Experience required
   - Upper age limit
   - Reservation by category (UR, SC, ST, OBC, EWS)
   - Salary or CTC
   - Job location
   - Selection process

4. Followed the format and style** used in the HURL and IIT Palakkad tabs provided as examples — ensuring consistency in tone, structure, and completeness.

5. Filled all 5 pending sheets** in the Excel file:
   -  CSIR
   -  NHM
   -  NTPC
   -  TANUVAS
   -  AAU

6. Verified all entries** for accuracy and formatting before finalizing the submission.
